## How to stepup the App
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
- run ```nodemon run dev``` to start the backend sever
- open the context file inside the src folder, on client folder, then change the socket io sever address to ```http://localhost5000```
- switch the directory to client in your terminal and run ```npm start``` to start the frontend

## How to delopy the App
- You can use your prefered site to delopy the backend sever but I personally use ```heroku``` to delopy the backend, If you're interested you can go to <a href="www.heroku.com">heroku</a>
- switch to the client folder in your terminal and run ```npm run build``` to create a build folder for your frontend, can use <a href="www.netlify.com">netlify</a> to delopy the frontend.
- Congratulation your App is live to viewedüåê‚ú®.
